        "A sprinkle of magic powder had Staurt hallucinating, walls were not straight anymore and chandeliers were falling from the ceiling. "
        f"When {char_ali()} got to the studio {char_laur()} had disappeared so since she was busy she quickly left to go to her 17th appointment of the day after refusing {char_pix()}’s pixie dust as she had to drive and was scared for her drivers license to be taken away. "
        f"{char_amr()} was next but they had to wait for {char_mati()} to get there since she was the only one who could understand him given her powers. {char_pix()} kept chilling in a corner enjoying the company of her atypical friends."

        f"{char_mati()} had to do no translation anymore, her power was useless and she felt lost without it. {char_ali()} revived the mushroom that had gotten wrinkly from absorbing all of the sadness in the surrounding area. "
        f"{char_pix()} asked the sun (still a star at the end of the day) to play some music in the background and Sabrina Woodworker filled the air. The mood lightened up in a second."

        f"{char_ali()} and {char_mati()} looked into it and flickering at the bottom of it the truth came into sight. Their eyes unlocked and filled with tears. "
        "Having spent their whole life looking for their long lost twins and finally being reunited filled their hearts with joy. "
        f"Star dust fell from the sky and the bright moon lit the room, making this a moment {char_amr()}, even during his long life, would never forget."
